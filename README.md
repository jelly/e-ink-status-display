# 7.5" E-ink home status display

Work in progress e-ink home status display, showing news, weather information
and hopefully soon much more. Currently heavy work in progress and unstable,
but also awfully slow on an rpi zero W for still unknown reasons so it
takes ~ 1 minute to update the screen. 26 seconds for clearing the screen and
further drawing and setup 30 seconds.
